# Environment Variables and Property Files

I'm used to working with Node.js and using .env files to work with environment variables, but different approach is required for Java.

I define my environment variables manually in my system settings and I use property files to store the names of those environment values. I can access the values of my environment variables by getting the values from my property files and then using those values to get the values from my environment variables.

# GitHub Users

This is really annoying, but I acidentally made a commit from my old GitHub account.
